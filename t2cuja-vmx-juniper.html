Download Juniper vMX Router 15.1F4 for VMWare Can someone recommend a vendor that has better pricing and technical expertise than CDW? They are good for a lot of things, but I think for this order it would be better to talk to someone else.

Hi Everyone, I work for a school district with around 3k active users. We have been implementing BGP with our ISPs and it has been working good up until now. We are currently using our Fortigate's as both our BGP router and firewalls. The performance is great, however we need some added functionality that only a standalone router can solve. At the moment we have the full BGP internet routes setup from Comcast and another provider, I am looking at summarizing the routes

Hey Guys, Has anyone else run into an issue with the vMX images where the FPC becomes "absent" if you have more than one vMX image running?

Cегодня Juniper Networks предлагает практически исчерпывающий  модели до топовой, а также виртуальное устройство vMX (подробнее о нем ниже). Hi all - considering replacing an aging ASA solution that's used for site-to-site VPN. we're on the same campus - raw bandwidth and latency are excellent. I have jumbo frames between the VPN endpoints so I can run without worrying about client MTU and fragmentation badness. The current ASA solution tops out at about 200Mbps. I'm toying with the idea of a pair of juniper VMX's. Also toying with the idea of using a (behind a firewall) windows box as the vpn endpoint, with direct Один из ведущих мировых производителей телекоммуникационного оборудования. Изначально предложив инновационный подход к построению. I work with juniper ex4200 and ex4300 switches on a daily basis and I absolutely love how versatile they are. I do internal routing on them (external is done through Quagga/Bird BGP boxes) as well as some firewalling. I also have a few srx240 clusters but I don't touch those very often (no need). I would like to get certified, preferably on the data centre or service provider track but obviously, buying equipment to practice on is out of the question for a mere mortal.

Hey folks, https://www.dropbox.com/s/hgetayo827qrv68/JNCIS-Study-Guides.tar.gz?dl=0 No expiry date this time. Password is "juniper123" (no quotes) These are enough to get you into the JNCIP level exams of each focus, they are overkill for JNCIS alone. I've downloaded these images, have them working in VMWare Workstation player, but I cant figure out how you "connect" devices like you can in GNS3. I want to build out a virtual lab, but it seems like Im missing something. Googling has lead me to vSphere for virtual switch, but I just want to connect interfaces together to build out some lab networks. What am I missing? Anyone got a link, or advice I have two ex2200-c switches and three SRX100s. Just wondering if there is any other kit I need for JNCIS-SP and potentially JNCIP-SP. Thanks. Hi all, I've been running an ESXI server for quite a while now, however while trying to configure and set up IOS XRv for some testing, Im unable to get serial to work, when I boot up the IOS XRV or in another case the vIOS-L2 image, I see the image linked below while the virtual machine is up: https://imgur.com/MFI4mEE (https://imgur.com/MFI4mEE) Here is the complete settings for the serial: https://imgur.com/EzlKxYX (https://imgur.com/EzlKxYX) I have opened up the firewall to allow serials. 
Hello guys, I wish you have great start in the new year. I have one question about Juniper's vMX. I am doing bachelor thesis about Dual-Stack lite, and as a practical part, I wanted to simulate it. For simulation I am using GNS3 and I have CP and FP on KVM qemu virtuals with enough RAM and CPU as it was specified in requirements. I am running 18.03R1 on them. I have tried numerous configurations from internet, and I ended up botching this creature Hello, I am trying to set up a Group VPN between a cisco GC/KS and 3 vMX router (14.1R1.10) and another cisco router as a member. I've managed to get the Group VPN working between the two cisco router, but I have dificulties configuring the vMX routers an maybe someone here can help. Config for GM-1 (https://forums.juniper.net/t5/forums/postpage/board-id/txt.do/1s26n) (juniper vMX router as a group member). Config for GC/KS (https://forums.juniper.net/t5/forums/postpage/. Good day. So generally, I am a Cisco Network Engineer by trade, but in my current role we manage a number of Juniper MX5 and MX80 routers. Some of these are running pretty old code from what I can tell, 11.4 etc. We need to upgrade these, clearly. I've successfully upgraded a vMX instance from 16 to 18 in VirtualBox so I think I understand the upgrade procedure. Now, with the real bare metal boxes, can I jump from 11.4 to 18.2? We only have 2 devices on 11.4, some others My company is considering replacing our Cisco MPLS core with Juniper MX routers. I haven't worked on Junipers in over a decade, so I'm looking to get up to speed and go through the Juniper SP track. From the research I've done so far the vMX routers would be great for the routing portion, but they are only a 60 day trial. The 100mbps images are over 0 a piece which is pretty pricey given I'd like a topology of at least 10 devices. Are there any lab license options available 
I've got a vMX server set up using almost the exact configuration detailed here: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en\_US/vmx18.1/topics/task/installation/vmx-install-preparing.html (https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/vmx18.1/topics/task/installation/vmx-install-preparing.html) Host is built off a Supermicro X9DRL-iF connected to a juniper EX-3200. Performed the standard steps to connect one of the host NICs to a vMX interface, pretty straightforward to that point. The problem. My MPLS post the other week was pretty well received so I figured might as well show the other side of the coin and do it again with Juniper boxes. #Topology Today's Topology (https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Au5BQLPk/juniper-mpls.png) is similar to last time but Juniperified, we have: 4 x PE routers that are vMX 4 x P are vSRX 4 x CE routers are VSRX boxes as well. There are again two customers, CUST-A and CUST-B because originality is hard. To save on some config space. Cisco is great! But let's shake things up a bit by seeing how the other side of the fence does things. Today we'll be playing with some Juniper vMX routers and seeing how they work with a Cisco. #In the Beginning When you first console into a Juniper router you'll have to sign in with `root`, you'll then be kicked to the FreeBSD shell until you type `cli` to get into Juniper land. root@:~ # cli root> We'll end up in Juniper's version of the privileged Anyone know anything about Spectrum (Time Warner Cable) Business Internet connections? I'm trying to order service for my homelab. If I order two 100x10 Mbps connections can I play with things like multi-homed GBP? My end use case would be to buy or rent a class C block and use it for an OpenStack floating IP pool. I intend to run OpenContrail with OpenStack and Juniper's vMX for the edge routers. Also, if I order a block of static IP addresses with one connection, can I share the IPs between. Hey all. Hopefully a stupid question! I'm working on getting a vMX working as a DHCP server in GNS3. I'm using routing instances. I've done packet captures on the link the discovers should be coming in on, and the DHCP Discover packets are being transmitted on the link. The DHCP statistics from the router show the router is receiving the DHCP Discover packets, yet dropping them due to "Authentication". I've looked for anything I could find regarding Juniper, DHCP, and authentication Greetings fellow traders! Hope everyone else is ready to enjoy the weekend, I'm off to work lol EDIT: Currently at work, I can provide pictures of anything when I get home. I can't promise speedy replies but I will be checking throughout the day. I just bought a WOTC collection yesterday, so I have some new things available for sell/trade.
