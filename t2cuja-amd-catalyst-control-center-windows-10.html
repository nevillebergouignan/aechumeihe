                            <p> From here ( I know we have a lot of users on limited data plans around here, so, thought it would be worth mentioning considering they may want to conserve as much as possible for when 2.0 goes public in two weeks or so. It seems to target software that indexes hardware so it shouldn't effect the core game files. But, a lot of driver packages are 250MB. Which adds up if you only get a few gigs per month. Has anyone else experienced this? It's not a big deal but I don't know why it happened, I liked the shiny new Crimon. I noticed the other day that CCC wasn't running so I tried to find it but found out that it wasn't installed. I uninstalled the drivers to try and get it installed but once it tries to install CCC the installer skips to the end of the process and says the driver installed with errors. I've been reading forums but they mostly deal with a different error or different a OS. Also, the display driver works fine and I can still use Afterburner to overclock. Any help would be appreciated.

Any help would be appreciated. I got Windows 10 Pro installed on my iMac, Windows got most of the drivers and the rest I installed as individually/manually from the Boot Camp installer folder. I have display (Windows recognizes the ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT, Device Manager shows Generic UPnp Monitor), Sound, Bluetooth, iSight, Network, etc. The last hurdle is the brightness, there is no option anywhere to adjust it at all. I checked for latest drivers including ATI/AMD Catalyst drivers, there is no option in display settings Computer Type: HP Notebook Laptop GPU: Using AMD E1-6015 APU with Radeon R2 Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 8200 / R3 Series CPU: AMD E1-6015 APU with Radeon R2 Graphics Motherboard: HP 8137 laptop motherboard RAM: All I know is it is 4 GB ddr3.

Background Applications: None Description. I've posted this in comments here before but I got this working pretty good on a laptop that struggles with Youtube videos today, on wifi. If you've got an older machine running with an AMD (I've got a low end one and a very low end one) chipset this will probably benefit you the most. Obviously wired is better than wireless and if your machine is low end don't have a bunch of other applications running while you're trying to stream. 1. Turn off any video enhancements on your video card. Hello everyone! I am having an issue where I can see grids on all of the walls/ceiling/floor. The grids do not disappear throughout gameplay. They appear blue and change to white after a time (resembling poor clipping/texture gaps). Fixes I have applied so far: 1. Copied "WolfNewOrder_x64.exe", rename dupe to "WolfNewOrder_x32.exe" and create "steam_appid.txt" with only "201810" at the first line. Run from desktop shortcut, not steam. 2. Created texture cache in "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Loca. Almost every game, my game crashes and disconnects. I have to close the game and turn it back on to get back into my game. This is so frustrating and making me want to quit! Edit 1: I tried turning off Windows Defender and have had no issues for the past few games. I guess I'll not be using AV while I play this. Does anyone know of a good way to whitelist this game on Windows Defender or an antivirus software that has no issues with the game? Edit 2: Nevermind, it just happened again. Turning. 
Hello guys, I’ve been having issues trying to install a XFX ATI HD 6850 on my friend’s Windows 10 PC. I plug it into to the PCIE slot, connect the one PCIE cable, and proceed to install the AMD drivers. Here’s where the problems begin. First, I used DDU to uninstall the previous drivers, as he had a GTX 460 before. I went through the process, and then went to the AMD website. I find the driver download page for the 6850. Now, there are 2 options, one for this Crimson installer SPECS: HP Pavilion g4 Windows 10-64 bit 8GB RAM Intel core i3-3110M CPU Intel HD Graphics 4000 AMD Radeon 7600M Series (switchable graphics) One day, I downloaded this old game (HP Half-Blood Prince) and it didn't work; I only got a black screen. I read up a guide and something mentioned tinkering with the Switchable Graphics settings. I booted up AMD Catalyst Control Center (CCC) to force the game's .exe to use the AMD, in case it wasn't already. But it seems my AMD-CCC I have a Non-PnP generic monitor that my video card detects. It will not go away and I can't find the way to remove it. Screen windows interface doesn't even have the "remove monitor" option (screenshot at the bottom) and removing it from device manager only has it return after a few minutes or in every reboot. Said ghost monitor is listed as my #1 device, while my actual monitor is listed as a projector on #2. I have #2 as my main device, naturally. Why is this an issue: The constant detecti. Hey all, I have a Sony Vaio laptop that I'm trying to fix, but haven't really had any progress. When you put it in sleep mode and wake it up, it gives you the BSOD, then goes to a black screen that says "Operating System not found". When you restart it, it runs just fine as long as it doesn't go into sleep mode. Here are the specs on it from dxdiag - amp#x200B; gtOperating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 17134) (17134.rs4\_release.180410-1804) gt gtLanguage: English.

Okay, so apparently it all started with me realizing that I wanted to change my graphics settings from Integrated (Intel) to Dedicated (AMD) graphics. So I decide. My work computer was running slow using the onboard video so I decided to try installing a video card, something I've done dozens of times before on my personal computer just fine. Here is the computer info: Computer Type: Desktop, Dell Optiplex 755 GPU: AMD 6450 1gb dd3 CPU: Intel Core Duo CPU E6750 2.66GHz Motherboard: Hard to find, it's a generic dell motherboard that supports Intel Core Duo RAM: 8Gb PSU: whatever power supply comes in the Dell Optiplex 755 Operating System I built my PC some years ago, and everything was fine until the GPU fans started spinning like crazy two days ago for no reason (I was installing Plays.tv when it happened). I have a 8192MB HIS Radeon R9 390 IceQ X2 OC. Since then I tried updating the AMD driver to the latest version, cleaned the GPU from dust, shut down and rebooted the PC several times, uninstalled the AMD driver with the device manager and DDU in Safe Mode, reinstalled the driver, tried the same thing with several 
Upon attempting to install AMD HD 6450 card, the driver installation fails and it says I have installed Radeon hd 7400 Series in device manager? Background: My work computer was running slow using the onboard video so I decided to try installing a video card, something I've done dozens of times before on my personal computer just fine. Here is the computer info: Computer Type: Desktop, Dell Optiplex 755 GPU: AMD 6450 1gb dd3 CPU: Intel Core Duo CPU E6750 2.66GHz Motherboard: Title says it all. Recently, I noticed a dip in game performance and saw that games weren't detecting my Radeon 8700M card. Checking Device Manager, the card is not shown and all that is there is the onboard Intel 4000 graphics. When right clicking the desktop or an app, I used to have an option from AMD for "Graphics Properties" or something like that, which would open the AMD Settings menu and let me change to High Performance and enable the card. This option isn't there anymore. Hello everyone, (I hope that this is the right subreddit to post this) I am currently searching for a fan control program. My PC specs are as follows: Mainboard: ASRock 990FX Extreme 4 CPU: AMD FX(tm)-8300 Eight-Core Processor GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB OS: Windows 10 64Bit (Build 16299) Until recently I had used the AXTU program by ASRock, but it suddenly started telling me it wasn't for this system and instead of booting it just showed error messages. Since then I haven't 
This'll be a long one. My computer's been having some issues for the last couple months. Money's pretty scarce, so I've been reluctant to attempt to fix the issue knowing it will likely cost me several hundred dollars. However as of the last couple days, the severity of the issues is becoming increasingly infuriating, and I'm now attempting to do everything I can to the computer to see if the problem can be fixed without replacing any of the hardware. The most apparent issue Hey guys, Noob problem here, looking for a little bit of help with my first build: so I'm trying to get my graphics card to work with my windows 10 setup. It's an AMD radeon 6950, which is no longer officially supported by AMD it seems. I tried plugging my monitor into it and the monitor wouldn't show anything. Plugging the monitor directly into my motherboard works, but not the actual gpu. I tried to install the the 6950's drivers, but I'm having issues with installing them. Basically the probl. I have the game going blackscreen and showing me a dialog box that says this. I'm using directx 11 mode, and it literally just started yesterday, after windows updated. I figured "maybe it's the update" and undid the two things that updated, to no avail. It happened several times more, and i'm not sure why. F.Y.I. AMD 5700 series Windows 10 1 gig video ram 8 gigs ram on pc Driver packaging version : 15.20.1062.1004-150803a1-187674C catalyst version : 15.7.1 AMD Catalyst Control. Introduction: After resisting upgrade fever for the past year, I finally decided it was time to replace my three year old 7950. In order to assess the benefits of my latest hardware upgrade, I ran a substantial number of benchmarks. I thought all that data might be of use to someone else considering a similar upgrade, so I decided to write a little review. I apologize for the amateur quality of my writing, and hope this review can help some of my fellow PC enthusiasts to plan their Hello I have an AMD R9 290 and 8 gbs of ram. I experience fps spikes and 1-3 second freezes in the first town. On my fps counter when the freeze ends it says I am at 1 fps. Also when I create a file user.cfg in the main folder to force no vertical sync it doesnt apply to the game. Same when I go into Catalyst Control Center to force no V sync in there as well. Also no fps caps are working from CCC or from user.cfg. Is anyone else having these issues? I really </p>
